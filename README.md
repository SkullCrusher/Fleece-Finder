# Fleece-Finder

This is a e-commerce website I wrote from scratch. The client was looking for something to sell sheep Fleece on. I built this spin this off into a full product that people could buy once the contract was complete. After I completed the site but I felt that there were better solutions on the market place so I didn't continue with it.

# Installing
I am working on building a docker file that will make it easy to install but it's not complete. I know I was using php 5, MySQL, and IIS but I don't remember the versions.
